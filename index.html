Very few people understand the powerful emotion of fear and why it distorts our perceptions. Fear manifests itself in many different ways. It accompanies humans in everyday life. It can be as small as a bee. It can be as big as an elephant. It can be as complex as existential anxiety in a human.

Fear is a deeply wired reaction evolved over the history of biology, protecting organisms
against perceived threat to their integrity or existence. It is personal, powerful and a raw emotion. It can make your whole body stop from working or it can be the fuel that drives you. Fear leads us more often than not into irrationality, unpredictable behaviour and madness.

The emotion of fear has a commanding moral position within the society of the 21st century. Today, larger systems of fear, such as politics, religion and the media are feeding human society and influence us in a detrimental way. Fear can be misused in all these systems of power in order to control, manipulate and divide society, which benefits the ones in positions of power.

Fear is real and illusion at the same time.

 When we take a quick look back into the extraordinary history of humans we will find many
questionable occasions and systems, which worked through infiltrating fear into society: Let
me just count some of the most excellent moments, where we distinguished ourselves, as
beings on this planet. Slavery, Colonialism, Witch-hunt, Ku-Klux-Klan, Nazi Regime, Trump
presidential period etc.

Within this thesis I am exploring how fear is a constant presence in our human lives and how it is used as a tool by people and systems of power in order to manipulate, control and divide within this patriarchal, christian and white-imposed system we live in.
I am reaching this goal by using different research-methods. On one hand I dive into academic ideas about this topic by providing the reader with a variety of viewpoints through quoting and introducing different scientists and their opinions working in the field. On the other hand

I was working on my own visual research around the topic of fear, which involved people from different age groups. (age 3-80) I am also drawing upon contemporary and personal examples regarding the topic in order to create a complete image for the reader. This thesis is specifically dedicated to all the children who were part of my visual research and who so bravely shared their most intimate stories with me. It is also dedicated to all other children and future generations out there, who are willing to question, discuss, debate and fight for a better system for this planet.
